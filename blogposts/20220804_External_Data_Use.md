2022-08-04 Clarification on External Data Use Traffic4cast 2022
================================================================

Dear Friends of Traffic4Cast!

To address recent questions regarding whether participants can use additional data for their models we have updated the formal Terms and Conditions for the competition. You will be asked to accept them when you next visit the website. Please find the updated paragraph below.

In a nutshell, if you can think of a way to make your models better by using additional data, that’s great! For fairness to all, however, these data must be equally available to use in the competition to everyone taking part. That means the data must be publicly accessible, and they must be released under a license that allows all participants to use them for this competition.

We look forward to seeing your most creative models succeed!   Please document any dependencies on external data or code for your final submission to the repository including code for data prep and modelling so that others can build on your work.

Happy Coding
Christian
